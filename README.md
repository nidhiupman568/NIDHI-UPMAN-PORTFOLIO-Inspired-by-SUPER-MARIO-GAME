## 🍄🕹️ Super Mario-Inspired Portfolio 🕹️🍄

🎉Welcome to my portfolio, designed to capture the nostalgic essence of the classic Super Mario game! 🎮✨ Here’s a detailed overview of the project, including controls, technologies used, development stages, challenges faced, and final thoughts. 🚀

## 🎮 Controls 🎮

You can move Mario to the left or right using the keyboard arrows on desktop or the arrow buttons on mobile. ⬅️➡️

## 🛠️ What I Used 🛠️

- **Graphics 🖼️**
- **Music and Sounds 🎶:** Sourced from YouTube videos 📺
- **🌐 HTML**
- **🎨 CSS**
- **💻 jQuery:** To simplify JavaScript coding 🛠️
- **📚 Google Fonts**

## 🌟 The Stages 🌟

1. **Start with the Basics 🏁**
2. **Add Little Details 🎨**
3. **Achieve Pixel Perfect Images 🖼️**
4. **Polish the Code 🧹**
5. **Overcome the Most Difficult Challenges 🚧**
6. **Resolve Additional Issues 🛠️**

### 🏁 Start with the Basics 🏁

On the screen, you'll see five primary elements:

1. **Mario 🍄**
2. **Sky 🌌** (clouds ☁️ + mountains 🏔️)
3. **Floor 🌱**
4. **Information Boxes 📦**
5. **Arrow Buttons 🔽🔼**

Steps to build this from scratch:
1. Write the HTML 🌐
2. Write the CSS 🎨
3. Write the JavaScript (and cry a bit) 💻😭
4. Test, test, test 🧪
5. Polish the code 🧹

### 🎨 Add Little Details 🎨

The Mario object is a simple `<img>` HTML tag with a transparent source image. The actual image is applied using the CSS `background` attribute. 🖼️

To create the Mario moving animation, I used a sprite image with three frames:
- **Frame 1:** `background-position-x: 0px;`
- **Frame 2:** `background-position-x: -65px;`
- **Frame 3:** `background-position-x: -130px;`

To change Mario's direction (left or right), I used the same image file with the CSS attribute `-webkit-transform`:
- **Left:** `-webkit-transform: scaleX(-1);`
- **Right:** `-webkit-transform: scaleX(1);`

### 🖼️ Achieve Pixel Perfect Images 🖼️

For the background image, I initially used a small image that appeared blurry on desktop. Adding the CSS attribute `image-rendering: crisp-edges` achieved crisp pixels. This small tweak made a significant difference. 🎨✨

### 🧹 Polish the Code 🧹

In the first version, there was a lot of duplicate code for user controls (key presses and arrow button clicks). I refactored the code to use functions, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability. 💻🧼

### 🚧 Overcome the Most Difficult Challenges 🚧

The most challenging part was handling all the JavaScript interactions, managing time intervals, and ensuring smooth controls on both desktop and mobile. 📅💻

### 🛠️ Resolve Additional Issues 🛠️

Some browsers, like Google Chrome, do not allow autoplaying music. To address this, I made the music play when the user interacts with the screen (e.g., clicks, presses keys, or clicks arrow buttons). 🎶🔊
